\usage{
enve.barplot(
  x,
  sizes,
  top = 25,
  colors.per.group = 9,
  bars.width = 4,
  legend.ncol = 1,
  other.col = "#000000",
  add.trend = FALSE,
  organic.trend = FALSE,
  sort.by = median,
  min.report = 101,

  col,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Can be either the input data or the path to the file containing 
the table. 
\itemize{
   \item{If it contains the data, it must be a data frame or an
   object coercible to a data frame.} 
   \item{If it is a path, it must point to a
   tab-delimited file containing a header (first row) and row names 
   (first column).}
   }}

\item{sizes}{A numeric vector containing the real size of the samples
(columns) in the same order of the input table. If set, the values are
assumed to be 100\%. Otherwise, the sum of the columns is used.}

\item{top}{Maximum number of categories to display. Any additional
categories will be listed as "Others".}

\item{colors.per.group}{Number of categories in the first two saturation 
groups of colors. The third group contains the remaining categories if 
needed.}

\item{bars.width}{Width of the barplot with respect to the legend.}

\item{legend.ncol}{Number of columns in the legend.}

\item{other.col}{Color of the "Others" category.}

\item{add.trend}{Controls if semi-transparent areas are to be plotted
between the bars to connect the regions (trend regions).}

\item{organic.trend}{Controls if the trend regions are to be smoothed 
(curves). By default, trend regions have straight edges. If \code{TRUE}, 
forces \code{add.trend=TRUE}.}

\item{sort.by}{Any function that takes a numeric vector and returns a
numeric scalar. This function is applied to each row, and the resulting
values are used to sort the rows (decreasingly). Good options include: 
\code{sd, min, max, mean, median}.}

\item{min.report}{Minimum percentage to report the value in the plot.
Any value above 100 indicates that no values are to be reported.}

\item{order}{Controls how the rows should be ordered. 
\itemize{
   \item{If \code{NULL} 
   (default), \code{sort.by} is applied per row and the results are 
   sorted decreasingly.}
   \item{If \code{NA}, no sorting is performed, i.e., the original
   order is respected.}
   \item{If a vector is provided, it is assumed to be the 
   custom order to be used (either by numeric index or by row names).}
   }}

\item{col}{Colors to use. If provided, overrides the variables \code{top}
and \code{colors.per.group}, but \code{other.col} is still used if the 
vector is insufficient for all the rows. An additional palette is available with
\code{col='coto'} (contributed by Luis (Coto) Orellana).}

\item{...}{Any additional parameters to be passed to barplot.}
}
\description{
Creates nice barplots from tab-delimited tables.
}
\examples{
# Load data
data("phyla.counts", package="enveomics.R", envir=environment())
# Create a barplot sorted by variance with organic trends
enve.barplot(
    phyla.counts, # Counts of phyla in four sites
    sizes=c(250,100,75,200), # Total sizes of the datasets of each site
    bars.width=2, # Decrease from default, so the names are fully displayed
    organic.trend=TRUE, # Nice curvy background
    sort.by=var # Sort by variance across sites
    )
