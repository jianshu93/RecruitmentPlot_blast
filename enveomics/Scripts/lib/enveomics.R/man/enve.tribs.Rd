enve.tribs(
  dist,
  selection = labels(dist),
  replicates = 1000,
  summary.fx = median,
  dist.method = "euclidean",
  subsamples = seq(0, 1, by = 0.01),

}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{Distances as a \code{dist} object.}

\item{selection}{Objects to include in the subsample. By default, all objects are
selected.}

\item{replicates}{Number of replications per point.}

\item{summary.fx}{Function to summarize the distance distributions in a given replicate. By
default, the median distance is estimated.}

\item{dist.method}{Distance method between random points and samples in the transformed
space. See \code{dist}.}

\item{subsamples}{Subsampling fractions.}

\item{dimensions}{Dimensions to use in the NMDS. By default, 5\% of the selection length.}

\item{metaMDS.opts}{Any additional options to pass to metaMDS, as \code{list}.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads to use.}

\item{verbosity}{Verbosity. Use 0 to run quietly, increase for additional information.}

\item{points}{Optional. If passed, the MDS step is skipped and this object is used
instead.  It can be the \code{$points} slot of class \code{metaMDS} 
(from \code{vegan}).
It must be a matrix or matrix-coercible object, with samples as rows and
dimensions as columns.}

\item{pre.tribs}{Optional. If passed, the points are recovered from this object (except if
\code{points} is also passed. This should be an \code{\link{enve.TRIBS}} object 
estimated on the same objects (the selection is unimportant).}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{\link{enve.TRIBS}} object.

\description{
Subsample any objects in "distance space" to reduce the effect of
sample-clustering. This function was originally designed to subsample
genomes in "phylogenetic distance space", a clear case of strong
clustering bias in sampling, by Luis M. Rodriguez-R and Michael R
Weigand.
