\title{Enveomics: Recruitment Plot (2) ANI Estimate}
\usage{
enve.recplot2.ANIr(x, range = c(0, Inf))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{enve.RecPlot2}} object.}

\item{range}{Range of identities to be considered. By default, the full range
is used (note that the upper boundary is \code{Inf} and not 100 because
recruitment plots can also be built with bit-scores). To use only
intra-population matches (with identities), use c(95,100). To use only
inter-population values, use c(0,95).}
