\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{enve.TRIBStest}} object to plot.}

\item{type}{What to plot. \code{overlap} generates a plot of the two contrasting empirical
PDFs (to compare against each other), \code{difference} produces a plot of the
differences between the empirical PDFs (to compare against zero).}

\item{col}{Main color of the plot if type=\code{difference}.}

\item{col1}{First color of the plot if type=\code{overlap}.}

\item{col2}{Second color of the plot if type=\code{overlap}.}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label.}

\item{xlim}{X-axis limits.}

\item{ylim}{Y-axis limits.}

\item{...}{Any other graphical arguments.}
